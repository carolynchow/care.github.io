								<p>The hardest thing about picking a fitness coach isn't finding one, but finding one that provides you with results. With so many gyms in the GTA it's hard to get over skepticisms when participating in a fitness program. I've been climbing for 3 years at Up the Bloc and I met Carolyn there as a fitness coach and active climber. Since then I've participated in her B-Fit and B-Strong fitness programs which introduced me to HIIT for the first time. It was hard for me to get used to the intense workouts, but Carolyn worked with me by giving technical feedback and positive reassurance along the way. Since then I've participated in her fitness programs which have greatly improved my overall strength and fitness in addition to improving my climbing performance and knowledge. When working with Carolyn I have observed that she is conscientious when she plans your workouts which she will explain if you're curious enough to ask. I've had discussions with her which have revealed her vast knowledge of body mechanics and passion in what she does. In addition to her conscientiousness she's also an open individual which unbeknownst to her has supported my mental health as a client. <b>The combination of traits and work ethic Carolyn possesses is something I haven't found in other fitness coaches near me.</b> I don't regret taking part in Carolyn's fitness programs and will continue to work with Carolyn in the future!

								<p>Carolyn helped me a lot to develop lower body strength and mobility. As a self-taught climber I neglected my legs and when it was time to assess that, personal workouts with Carolyn was the best solution for it. I discovered new techniques and started to enjoy weightlifting as a part of my exercise routines. Whenever any of my friends are thinking about getting serious about their fitness I always recommend Carolyn.

								<p>My first experience with a personal trainer was a group weightlifting course with Carolyn. I was at first hesitant as I was a beginner, but Carolyn was tremendously welcoming and provided a variety of workouts that I would come to feel confident in to try on my own. Carolyn's support and enthusiasm pushed me during challenges of wanting to give up. <br></br>

									The classes were always something I would look forward to because I knew she would ensure I was challenging myself, yet still keeping the class fun and exciting. I had such a positive experience that I signed up for additional courses she ran. I would recommend Carolyn to any individual in their fitness journey, as she has a vast knowledge and genuine passion that would inspire anyone to excel in their fitness goals.

								<p>My name is George Vavaroutsos, I’m 28 years old and I’ve been working with Carolyn for about 6 months. Starting off I wasn’t in the greatest shape, strong in a few areas, had some technique in training but overall, wasn’t able to connect my strength with the rest of my body. In just 6 months training with Carolyn, I’ve dropped a great amount of body fat, built some serious core and upper body strength, and have really started to be able hit my goals for fitness faster than I ever would have been able to just working out on my own. If you’re reading this and want to really make a change to your fitness and meet a great person along the way then I would highly recommend training with Carolyn!!

								<p>Among many, Carolyn’s knowledge in anatomy and body movements and the ability to teach her clients to achieve desired movements are the greatest assets to her and her clients. Training sessions with her makes this very apparent as she knows how to properly activate intended muscle groups and accurately direct me to effective and injury free workout. She has been fantastic in creating programs that are engaging and approachable that are also challenging enough for sustainable gains. Training sessions with her have always been fun, light hearted and motivating. I am extremely happy with what Carolyn and I were able to achieve up to this point and the continued progress we are making.

								<p>Carolyn is one of the most motivating and knowledgeable personal trainers I've worked with. Her in-depth knowledge of the human body and her sharpness in identifying, assessing, and developing any weaknesses to better achieve your goals are unparalleled. She is one of the best motivators and keeps you focused and on point during workouts so you always get the most out of every session. Carolyn will teach you, If you are open to and interested in how your body functions she will teach you so you better understand the workouts you are doing. She is always a trainer I go to when I'm looking for a regimen that will challenge me.
